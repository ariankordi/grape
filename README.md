At the time the below was written, I was actually working on it. I don't work on this anymore and am looking forward to giving it a complete and total re-write in another language having actually nearly exact things Miiverse did. Below is my original readme.md.

# grape #
A Miiverse clone, named which due to Miiverse's original codename being 'olive'.
Heavy work in progress.
There is a lot of naive programming in here, I'm new to PHP and it'll get better soon.

# grp_portal #
This is portal, or the Wii U mode.
# grp_offdevice #
The offdevice version. This was written when I knew more PHP then when I had written portal. It's way better written, and I'm trying to rewrite portal now.
# grp_act #
The account login and profile system shared across all of these.

# grplib #
Some shared libraries to be used across all of these. None of these are seen by the user.

# How to install??? #
Don't.
